# SlackNet
An easy-to-use and comprehensive API for writing Slack apps in .NET.

This project builds on the [Slack API](https://docs.slack.dev/apis/). You should [read through Slack's documentation](https://docs.slack.dev/) to get an understanding of how Slack apps work and what you can do with them before using SlackNet.

## Getting Started
There are three main NuGet packages available to install, depending on your use case.
  - [SlackNet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SlackNet/): A comprehensive Slack API client for .NET, including a socket mode client for receiving events.
  - [SlackNet.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SlackNet.AspNetCore/): ASP.NET Core integration for receiving requests from Slack.
  - [SlackNet.AzureFunctions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SlackNet.AzureFunctions/): Azure Functions integration for receiving requests from Slack.

A [SlackNet.Bot](SlackNet.Bot#slacknetbot) package for using Slack's deprecated RTM API is also available, but you're probably better off using the [Socket Mode client](#socket-mode) instead.

### SlackNet
To use the Web API, build the API client:
```c#
var api = new SlackServiceBuilder()
    .UseApiToken("<your bot or user OAuth token here>")
    .GetApiClient();
```
then call any of Slack's [many API methods](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/):
```c#
await api.Chat.PostMessage(new Message { Text = "Hello, Slack!", Channel = "#general" });
```

#### Socket Mode
To use the socket mode client:
```c#
var client = new SlackServiceBuilder()
    .UseAppLevelToken("<app-level OAuth token required for socket mode>")
    /* Register handlers here */
    .GetSocketModeClient();
await client.Connect();
```

A range of handler registration methods are available, but all require that you construct the handlers manually. You can simplify handler registration by integrating with a DI container. Integrations are provided for Autofac, Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection, and SimpleInjector. [Examples are provided](./Examples) for each of these options. 

### SlackNet.AspNetCore
Configure SlackNet in the setup of your ASP.NET Core app:
```c#
builder.Services.AddSlackNet(c => c
    .UseApiToken("<your bot or user OAuth token here>")
    .UseSigningSecret("<your signing secret here>"));
var app = builder.Build();
app.UseSlackNet();
```

Add event handler registrations inside the AddSlackNet callback. See the [SlackNetDemo](Examples/SlackNetDemo) project for more detail.

#### Developing with Socket Mode

While developing an ASP.NET application, you can use socket mode instead of needing to host the website publicly, by enabling socket mode with:

```c#
app.UseSlackNet(c => c.UseSocketMode());
```

#### Endpoints naming convention

SlackNet requires the Slack app endpoints to be named after the following convention:

| Endpoint            | Route                    |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Event subscriptions | `{route_prefix}/event`   |
| Interactivity       | `{route_prefix}/action`  |
| Select menus        | `{route_prefix}/options` |
| Slash commands      | `{route_prefix}/command` |

By default, the value of `{route_prefix}` is `slack`, but this can be configured like so:

```c#
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseSlackNet(c => c.MapToPrefix("api/slack"));
}
```

### SlackNet.AzureFunctions
SlackNet.AzureFunctions is based on SlackNet.AspNetCore, so you'll need to start by configuring [ASP.NET Core integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-process-guide#aspnet-core-integration).

Copy the [SlackEndpoints](Examples/AzureFunctionsExample/SlackEndpoints.cs) class into your project. This provides the functions for Slack to call, and delegates request handling to SlackNet.

Configure SlackNet in the setup of your Azure Functions app:
```c#
hostBuilder.ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication(builder => builder.UseSlackNet());
hostBuilder.ConfigureServices(services => services
    .AddSlackNet(c => c
        .UseApiToken("<your bot or user OAuth token here>")
        .UseSigningSecret("<your signing secret here>")));
```

Add event handler registrations inside the AddSlackNet callback. See the [AzureFunctionsExample](Examples/AzureFunctionsExample) project for more detail.

> Note: Early responses are not supported in Azure Functions, so be sure to finish handling requests in a timely manner.


## Examples
[Several example projects](./Examples) are provided to help you get started.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Currently, changes must be made on a feature branch, otherwise the CI build will fail.

Slack's API is large and changes often, and while their documentation is very good, it's not always 100% complete or accurate, which can easily lead to bugs or missing features in SlackNet.
Raising issues or submitting pull requests for these sorts of discrepencies is highly appreciated, as realistically I have to rely on the documentation unless I happen to be using a particular API myself.
